# SOP ENGINE PROJECT STATUS

**Version:** 1.2\
**Status:** Core Stable — Temporal Layer In Progress

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Purpose

This document is the technical source of truth for the Research Engine.

The Research Engine is **not** the SOP itself.

Its sole responsibility is transforming historical market data into
objective, reproducible and explainable evidence.

The SOP (Sistema Operativo Patrimonial) is the product.

The Constitution and the governance protocols decide how that evidence
is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Source of Truth Declaration (RE-DOC-001)

This document is the single official source of truth for the status
of the Research Engine.

`docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` are **not** authoritative.
They predate this declaration, contain roadmap information that no
longer matches this document, and are marked pending consolidation.
They should not be updated as a substitute for this file. A future,
dedicated iteration will merge or retire them — not before the
Observable Universe block (RE-023.x) is stabilized.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Governance Principles

-   The Constitution is the highest authority.
-   Engines produce evidence, never portfolio decisions.
-   The architecture is modular.
-   Every module has one responsibility.
-   Explainability is preferred over sophistication.
-   Small compatible iterations are preferred over large refactorings.

# Core Maturity Declaration

Starting with **version 1.0**, the Core architecture is considered
**stable**.

The following components are frozen as part of the Core:

-   Dataset Engine
-   Snapshot Engine
-   Drawdown calculations
-   Similarity Engine
-   Probability calculations
-   Normalization framework
-   Core domain models

Changes to these components should only occur when:

-   a functional defect exists,
-   objective evidence demonstrates incorrect behaviour,
-   or a governance decision explicitly authorizes the modification.

The primary effort of the project now shifts away from infrastructure
and towards functional capabilities:

1.  Evidence generation.
2.  Market assessment.
3.  Evidence-based inference.
4.  Executable constitutional rules.
5.  Portfolio governance protocols.

This declaration marks the end of the infrastructure phase and the
beginning of the functional phase of the Sistema Operativo Patrimonial.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Frozen Core Policy

The Core should remain stable.

Infrastructure refactoring must never be performed simply because a
cleaner design is possible.

Changes require objective justification.

## Exceptions invoked

-   **RE-021.** Similarity Engine (frozen) was modified to remove
    `recovery` (an Outcome variable) from the global similarity
    score. Justification: objective evidence of a data-leakage
    defect — Outcome participating in episode selection biased the
    resulting evidence. Authorized under "a functional defect
    exists."

# Component Status

  Component           Status
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------
  Dataset Engine      Stable
  Snapshot Engine     Stable
  Similarity Engine   Stable (RE-021 exception — see Frozen Core Policy)
  Observable Universe In progress (RE-023.1–023.4 done, not wired)
  Evidence Engine     v1
  Assessment Engine   v1
  Inference Engine    Planned
  Constitution        Planned
  Protocol Engine     Planned
  Dashboard           Planned

# Evidence Definition

Evidence must always contain three dimensions.

## Evidence

Objective historical statistics.

Examples:

-   mean outcome
-   median outcome
-   probability
-   recovery time
-   dispersion

## Confidence

How trustworthy the evidence is.

Examples:

-   sample size
-   similarity quality
-   consistency

## Quality

Quality of the historical dataset.

Examples:

-   missing data
-   structural breaks
-   outliers
-   coverage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Design Decisions

## RE-001

Future performance is measured using CAGR.

## RE-002

Evidence uses `future_return_5y`.

## RE-003

Assessment separates:

-   Market Position
-   Valuation Zone
-   Volatility Regime

## RE-004

Similarity excludes recent historical episodes by default.

## RE-005

Confidence is part of the Evidence object.

No standalone Confidence Engine will exist.

## RE-021

Outcome (`recovery`) removed from the global similarity score in
`SimilarityEngine`. Recovery remains under Outcome, descriptive only
— it must never influence which episodes are selected as matches.
See Frozen Core Policy exception above.

## RE-022

`SimilarityEngine.__init__` accepts an optional `cape_metric`
parameter, so a calibration built from observable episodes only can
be injected instead of recalculating over the full canonical
Dataset. Not yet wired to any caller.

## RE-023.1 — ObservableEpisode

New, independent type (does not inherit from `Episode`) representing
an episode as it could be observed at a given instant. Deliberately
not a subtype of `Episode`, to make it impossible for a canonical
and an observable episode to be substituted for one another by
accident.

## RE-023.2 — ObservableUniverse (skeleton)

`ObservableUniverse(dataset, as_of)` introduced. `episodes()` is an
identity transformation at this stage — validates the plumbing
before any temporal rule is added. Internally stores a copy of
`dataset.data` already filtered to `as_of`, never a reference to the
full canonical Dataset, so future methods cannot forget to filter it.

## RE-023.3 — Temporal masking of Outcome

`ObservableUniverse` masks Outcome fields (`recovery_*`,
`future_return_Xy`, `probability_positive_Xy`) to `None` when they
would not yet be observable at `as_of`, evaluated per field/horizon
— not per episode. Event and Context are never masked.

## RE-023.4 — Temporal existence of episodes

`ObservableUniverse.episodes()` now excludes episodes whose
`bottom_date > as_of` entirely. Cutoff uses `bottom_date`, not
`peak_date`: Event/Context are only fixed once the bottom is
reached. This does not yet replace the `peak_date`-based filter in
`SimilarityEngine.top()` — that removal is scoped for RE-023.6,
after wiring (RE-023.5) exists.

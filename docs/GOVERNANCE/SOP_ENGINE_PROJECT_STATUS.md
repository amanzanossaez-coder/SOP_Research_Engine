# SOP ENGINE PROJECT STATUS

**Version:** 1.1\
**Status:** Core Stable

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Purpose

This document is the technical source of truth for the Research Engine.

The Research Engine is **not** the SOP itself.

Its sole responsibility is transforming historical market data into
objective, reproducible and explainable evidence.

The SOP (Sistema Operativo Patrimonial) is the product.

The Constitution and the governance protocols decide how that evidence
is used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Governance Principles

-   The Constitution is the highest authority.
-   Engines produce evidence, never portfolio decisions.
-   The architecture is modular.
-   Every module has one responsibility.
-   Explainability is preferred over sophistication.
-   Small compatible iterations are preferred over large refactorings.

# Core Maturity Declaration

Starting with **version 1.0**, the Core architecture is considered
**stable**.

The following components are frozen as part of the Core:

-   Dataset Engine
-   Snapshot Engine
-   Drawdown calculations
-   Similarity Engine
-   Probability calculations
-   Normalization framework
-   Core domain models

Changes to these components should only occur when:

-   a functional defect exists,
-   objective evidence demonstrates incorrect behaviour,
-   or a governance decision explicitly authorizes the modification.

The primary effort of the project now shifts away from infrastructure
and towards functional capabilities:

1.  Evidence generation.
2.  Market assessment.
3.  Evidence-based inference.
4.  Executable constitutional rules.
5.  Portfolio governance protocols.

This declaration marks the end of the infrastructure phase and the
beginning of the functional phase of the Sistema Operativo Patrimonial.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Frozen Core Policy

The Core should remain stable.

Infrastructure refactoring must never be performed simply because a
cleaner design is possible.

Changes require objective justification.

# Evidence Definition

Evidence must always contain three dimensions.

## Evidence

Objective historical statistics.

Examples:

-   mean outcome
-   median outcome
-   probability
-   recovery time
-   dispersion

## Confidence

How trustworthy the evidence is.

Examples:

-   sample size
-   similarity quality
-   consistency

## Quality

Quality of the historical dataset.

Examples:

-   missing data
-   structural breaks
-   outliers
-   coverage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Design Decisions

## RE-001

Future performance is measured using CAGR.

## RE-002

Evidence uses `future_return_5y`.

## RE-003

Assessment separates:

-   Market Position
-   Valuation Zone
-   Volatility Regime

## RE-004

Similarity excludes recent historical episodes by default.

## RE-005

Confidence is part of the Evidence object.

No standalone Confidence Engine will exist.

# Project Axioms

-   SOP is the product.
-   Research Engine produces evidence.
-   Evidence must be explainable.
-   Governance is above prediction.
-   Robustness is preferred over sophistication.
-   Every iteration modifies one responsibility.
-   Stability has priority over novelty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Changelog
